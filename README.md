If you want to learn Go in the best possible way, this is the best place for you :D

With this base code, you can generate simple CRUD API (Get Many, Get One by ID, Store, Update, Delete & Restore) by follow these simple steps:
1. Create your model
2. Add your model to the auto migrate function on config/db.go
3. Create your controller by copy-paste from existing controller (for example product_controller). Then modify your controller as needed (you must modify function and model name)
4. Add routes on routes/routes.go
5. Done!
